The only remaining challenge is testing with a developer installation. The test suite does not currently build for AS.\n",

        "I've been talking with the `pyg-team` and they are interested in supporting AS more fully. It's a matter of time and resources. `rusty1s` (the lead developer) has been very helpful and responsive, adding a test runner for Apple Silicon.\n",

The project founder (@rusty1s) has noted that M1 was not supported from the onset - when it wasn't available on github actions, and there are no plans to support it now. Later Apple Silicon is supported, but developer build are variable.\n",
