![The First Job](./How-to-Land-L-desktop-2.webp)


I was recently asked by a friend to speak to new graduates about how to land their first job in industry. It's a time of trepidation and excitement, and I remember it well. I put together these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UZdZm6dugE7ekN04Vl4d8gx8JnngA7_t91rTzQpdvi0/edit?usp=sharing), maybe they will help you, or someone you know.
